        <p><strong>Last Updated: January 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Order Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>No cancellations are allowed after ordering.</strong> 
            Once an order is placed and payment is processed, it is automatically forwarded to the merchant for preparation to ensure speed and efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Refunds may be issued if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The merchant rejects the order due to unavailability</li>
            <li>You are charged but the order is not received</li>
            <li>A duplicate payment occurred</li>
            <li>A verified technical error happened during payment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Refund Processing Time</h2>
        <p>
            Approved refunds are processed through Razorpay/Cashfree.
            Refunds may take <strong>5–7 business days</strong> to reflect in your account.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Change of mind after placing the order</li>
            <li>Delays due to high merchant workload</li>
            <li>Incorrect details provided by the user</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
